## Introduction

In this repo you can find a number of plugins for Blender to facilitate creation of georeferenced 3D models of neghbourhoods. The list of plugin is presented below.

[Blender](http://www.blender.org) is a free and open source 3D platform. It supports 3D modeling and rendering as well as many advanced features like animation, simulation, compositing, motion tracking, video editing and game creation.
[Here](https://github.com/vvoovv/blender-geo/wiki/Learning-Blender) I describe my way way to learn Blender.

A general description how to create georeferenced 3D models of neighborhoods with Blender and OpenStreetMap data can be found [here](https://github.com/vvoovv/blender-geo/wiki/3D-Models-of-Neighborhoods).


## Plugins for Blender

* <code>Import OpenStreetMap (.osm)</code>
Import a file in the OpenStreetMap format (.osm)

* <code>OpenStreetMap Georeferencing</code>
OpenStreetMap based object georeferencing

* <code>Target Scaling</code>
Scale your model to the correct target size

* <code>One-vertex mesh object at the cursor location</code>
Create one-vertex mesh object at the cursor location
